# MtAw2e_Catalog
Spell catalogue and casting aid for Mage: The Awakening 2nd Edition. Meant to be used alongside a Discord bot that posts information and results to a channel.

Users will be prompted with a Guild (server) ID and Channel ID to post in to. You must include a channel that your bot has access to. The program will not validate these IDs before attempting to send results, so you may explore the program without the associated network functionality. 

On the main form, users have the ability to create and edit spells per Mage: The Awakening 2nd Edition's ruleset. Please refer to the official rulebook for a full list of spells and guidelines for creating new ones. A list of free-to-use example spells has been provided as a part of this application. 

When viewing a spell in the list, you may "cast spell" to bring up a spell form that allows for configuring and customizing the spell. This form also allows for creating and saving player characters to quickly load their personal information for curated spellcasting. The program will automatically roll the dice on your behalf and post the results to the target Discord server.
